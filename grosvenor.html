      The looming eyes of the mega poster glued to the side of the ymca <br>
recall <br>
Gatsby’s metaphor <br>
A packaged prose harkening dystopian future <br>
A brisk and foreign authoritarian past <br>
But none of that applies to this place: 2 Grosvenor Street, Toronto, Ontario
2020, July
<br><br>
Too many days and nights I’ve searched those eyes for something; I don’t know what <br>
they are large, lucid, and silent, like a friendly deity <br>
Gazing across to our little fire escape polluted by A and W exhaust <br>
That makes you hungry when you’re stoned <br>
<br><br>
Once I answered the aromatic calls of hot fries being cooked downstairs
Down the narrow steps of your toronto student walk up to the neon sign of your corporate neighbour<br><br>
The front doorway was haphazardly plastic plated, to protect workers from contamination; 
A shield against those untraceable drops of morbidity, carried on every word and breath in those days; the orders of unsuspecting customers and the shouts of addicts pacing the dirty gum slimed street; during the 6th month of the virus
<br><br>
At the ordering door there is a man, with the gestures of a woman; whose dreamcatcher tattoos and native lilt suggest his status <br>
His feather adorned forearm is shaking and flapping desperately; and the city pigeons roosting on your windowsill above stop to watch <br>
Him beg for handsanitizer <br>
through the plate glass window below the neon sign <br>
Just another fickle wizards drawing room <br>
And I thought he wanted to stay healthy; but you told me he just wanted something to drink
Some purell to drink<br>
Because the lcbo is too expensive to buy from and too armed to rob, and the windows are boarded up with plywood all down yonge street because of the protests and the riots in the states and the cops stand on every corner now; beckoning
<br><br>
Sometimes, these days, with all the tension, the cops will kneel when a man in a groovy sweater yells at them through a bullhorn <br>
they get off their traffic dodging bikes and raise a fist <br>
But these are toronto cops <br>
Lucrative, duplicitous<br>
<br><br>
They turn a blind eye to the young man now; and i’m drunk and i shed some tears into your shoulder at the a and w on the corner by Wellesley <br>
We both know he deserves a lot more <br>
<br><br>
And then a herd of motorcyclists race down yonge, they migrate every night at 9
And then the fire station beside your flat, bursts into life and colour
Another siren screaming disaster; the loudest one screaming for a house fire on the west end
<br><br>
Red sirens wash the streets of the cries of the noon marches; forgotten are the pickups with jamaican flags tacked onto their boots, boomboxes in the truck bed, hundreds of people trailing behind dancing for racial justice  <br>
they dance by the cars; towards the mall; beside the university; past the food trucks; on their pilgrimage to Dundas Square, that formerly lively intersection now relieved of the congestion caused by daily commuters.
<br><br>
They dance because cops keep killing people, although the centre of the action is across one national border and about 500 miles south <br>
Sometimes a young man or woman will halt and some protestors will mill around them or kneel on the ground and listen to the little novice prophet make their impassioned speech.
Then they chant things like: ‘no justice no peace no racist police’ <br>
Loyal members of Marxist organisations like Fightback flit through the crowd, passing out their stickers and pamphlets and newsletters: <br>
‘In a socialist state cops work for the people’ <br>
We sit in the windowsill, with fists raised and feet dangling over the crowd, they wave and smile
<br><br>
On alternating days a sparse crowd of looneys with tambourines and plastic horns trail in the wake of the BLM protestors; the anti-lockdowners parade solemnly towards the intersection, mangled and rabid they hold up home-made cardboard signs ‘vaccine = genocide’ 
Among their ranks sits a baby in a stroller, hand outstretched, grasping at the blistering sun, a fat woman in a motorised scooter, a tanned emaciated twitching man, and a blonde lady in lulu lemon leggings walking a dog <br>
‘why are republicans all so ugly?’ <br>
they’re weathered and wrinkled, beaten down and broke, some want to go to church again, or bookclub, or yoga. Some are convinced the House of Commons is densely populated with communist reptiles. they’re lonely, we’re all lonely, ‘they think sunscreen gives you cancer.’ <br>
you scream out the window ‘what about rwanda!!?’ 
<br><br>
Those sun drenched chants fade by the hour, the ancient man pleads purell, the immigrant worker politely stutters, the motors rev, cars race, and sirens call and the ink sky covets all of us underneath
<br><br>
The vast dark sky is a silent assurance that we have enough space to ruin ourselves and enough shrouded protection to remain anonymous while we do it
<br><br>
Kids race into the street, a knife is drawn, and drunken insults are thrown, it’s a fight and we run inside to film from our shelter
We need to capture the broken things we find; to help us remember the city sky’s lesson
My heart flutters when the light turns green; will the cars recognize the inscrutable tableau of vanity and rage playing out in the middle of the intersection?
The kids are avoided; they pack up and slink home once their lines are recited and the curtain is drawn
<br><br>
A text. ‘Spencer is hosting at purgatory tonight!’ <br>
Making it into purgatory is easy. They don’t check ID’s but they do check your pockets for drugs and weapons. <br>
Finding purgatory necessitates a guide. If you walk down Queen street then turn left down graffiti alley then turn left again down the back street where the shops and clubs ditch their garbage you’ll find a defunct payphone covered in stickers and paint, the receiver is balanced in a skeletal hand forged in metal, some forgotten work of art, I always thought it was very pretty and very vogue, <br>
beside this skeleton phone is a hidden door, painted into a psychedelic mural that covers the back of some store or bar that you’ll never have to see the front of.  If you knock on this door and you don’t look like a cop you’ll be granted admission to purgatory.  
Purgatory is nothing biblical, rather it is an apartment. A club promoter bought the apartment; he installed a bar and an atm and hosted parties all through the lockdown.
Tonight, ‘I can’t. I’m seeing my parents next week’ I can’t hurt them, the guilty populate purgatory
<br><br>
On our windowsill sits a tiny drug test tube housing a drop of neon green
A jaded reminder that we bought meth once on accident
In our cupboards are plates and cups that we slowly and methodically stole in preparation for off-campus living; expropriated from the University College dining hall during our first year at U of T
<br><br>
In the spice drawer we keep our narcan; for the homeless ones who are prone to slumping over while dumpster diving in the parking lot
<br><br>
under the glaring gatsby eyes of the ymca
<br><br>
We spend sleepless nights playing board games; wired on prescription amphetamines gifted from a friend, or bought from a man we knew in highschool who always shows up in a new car and old shoes <br> 
After nights like these we are caught by the sunrise, sitting on the fire escape with cups of coffee and a cigarettes <br>
We watch lines of masked patrons wait patiently outside grocery stores <br>
We watch construction workers across the road unpack their trucks – they are the essential <br>workers who risk their health to make big pits in the ground that condos go into <br>
The condos are important to keep rent prices down, but they block out the sun <br>
We watch the pit get deeper and deeper all summer <br>
While our living comes in emergency legislation and stimulus checks
<br><br>
The sky is glaring now; drills sound like cicadas reminding me of how they reminded me of the thrushes in my grandparents backyard during walks to summer camp past eglinton station
I always thought the cicadas in my grandparent’s backyard were far-off construction drills or a manifestation of the blistering sun <br>
We smoke a bowl and under this new sky everything feels like judgement <br>
And everyone yelling and dying and stammering and pleading the night before <br>
Has packed up and disappeared; a night time play; a mirage evaporated in the daylight <br>
<br><br>
Protestors call out down the block; they’re coming; let’s follow the march to the food trucks; or maybe down past the mall; we need to buy a microwave
