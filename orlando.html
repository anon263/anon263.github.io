            Orlando's Diary and no one else's, January 17, 2024
            <br><br>
hi i’m orlando and will you save me? … i’ve been thinking about it and i’m really sorry i just didn’t know who else to ask. and i just, i just really need help i mean i don’t have to get into it all, you know? it would really take too long, i’ve been this way for a while. i’ve just been thinking about it a lot recently, but like also always i guess. anyways basically i was just wondering if you would save me. so what do you say, are you down? can you do it? i know you’re not a doctor, or anything, i just need someone who feels like a fence, a fence on the edge of a cliff, a catcher in the rye i guess is what i’m getting at i need a thing to think about before i scream i need a thing that sees and feels and sees me and holds me in their tupperware eyes so would you? save me? maybe you could say something to fix it. you know, so many people have their words and they’re all fucking empty they’re so empty every time, these vague fucking rote categories, like their skulls are transparent and you can see all the bits of goo and scar and memory and pictureframe that made the sentences come out like that. but not yours. I’m sure yours would be better, you know? are you convincing? are you an orator? do you want to make something of yourself do you want to be elevated, worshipped, deified, defied? a god? because i need a god i never felt him in church the first time i prayed it was for something outrageous, i wanted to test the limits, it was an empirical assessment. anyways i guess i didn’t understand how god worked back then. but i learned eventually, he’s not supposed to answer you, then i wondered why there were so many people at mass. i remember slowly awakening to the nature of things. i revolted. i made up a list. the list got longer. i became quietly, secretly convinced that i had to recite this list every night, hands clasped in prayer, pleading for the protection of everyone and everything i held dear. genuinely worried that if i missed a night my world would collapse and my family would die. and i guess i also believed my stuffed animals would die because they were included. on the list. it was a chore for a few years. i decided to stop one night, consciously. i remember thinking it was just not worth it. that was around the time things started getting bad. i never told anyone. that was just prayer to me, something so mundane. i remember the first time i felt something at mass, it was during homily, the priest spoke gently, no booming voice, he told us why we’re all so sad all the time. it’s simple, he said, we are trying to be like god, god is perfect, we are destined to note his every absence and negation, it’s just our nature, to desire something like that, and to fail, it’s our nature to fail and to revolt against it again and again until we can’t anymore. i remembered that. <br>
but people don’t want perfection. no that doesn’t make any sense at all we wouldn’t know what to do with it, what to make of it, and we would likely find it dull. what people want is ballads and tragedies and anthems and wars, and posters with pretty blonde women holding fat gurgling babies and they’re docile and ignorant, our little stock of tabula rasa, and she reminds them to kill. we want to feel like we’ve always belonged right here, in 1914, in a mesmerising crowd, cheering outside the Reichstag, going to work with a renewed sense of purpose because everything’s going to war. every wind through the Schwarzwald’s ancient pines, every breath at war. something to rouse the spirit. time to make something of ourselves, would you like that? to make something of yourself? because i need something to live for and i’ll see you in full colour if you want, in colours that only shrimp in the atlantic see. the ones with 14 cones. and vision like stained glass. they discovered these shrimps recently, they’ve been discovering a lot now. and i always feel one step removed from everything i learn, like i’m catching up. like im running towards the starting line. and those are the moments i most want to make art and kill everything in me that tries to understand. understand in the holistic sense, the rationalist mirage that people delude themselves into believing is tangible, is almost right there. <br>
and then there are times when i truly believe i understand everything. and that’s the saddest thing in the world, the most paralysing grief. do you know? do you know? do you know? do you know? everything is exactly exactly exactly exactly what it is, do you understand that, theorist? truly? it’s been five years stuck on this structure you made with your spines and your pages. i took the gruelling climb, i wanted to believe you, every step i took i yearned for your eyes, to see like you, sometimes you surprised me, theorist, sometimes you took me along and i was mesmerised. at a young age i was mesmerised, the first is the most shocking, and i craved that thrill all the way up, and i trembled and my organs electrified every time i opened my mouth to speak because i understood what that might mean. and i clung to the scaffold when dark began it’s nightly creep across my world, gazing at hesperus the evening star and clinging to this geometric of iron bars that creak in a breeze and topple to nature. ‘imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves indifference as a power — how could you live in accordance with such indifference?’(1). what say you, theorist? to this indifference, what defiance do you propose in the face of the unholy infinite? will your meek words quell the gale of an omnipotent storm, how will you build your shelter and soothe your wounds. ? the frigidity of chaos, its indiscriminate destruction, the way tumultuous winds engulf and depose one another, trapped in nihilistic combat, will you use boards and nails?
<br><br>
you speak to this force so quietly, and from so so far away. 
<br><br>
but i am right here, and i am listening so intently and i am so beaten. from the wind and rain. and i have blue bruises and hot scars and i am so cold. so make me something beautiful and make me something to live in. and i’ll live in there all day. so long as i can fight for it, can i kill for it? i’ll nestle in the architecture and kill off every part of me that doesn’t belong. like glass, cut stained and ordered, a radiant mosaic of light. i know i have potential i’m not blind, i see all the colours that the shrimps in the atlantic see. they have 14 cones
