       -- birthplace of the neo hippie movement -- <br> <br>
what do we advocate? <br>
attempt kindness in all circumstances<br>
        forgive<br>
violence is bad<br>
we’re biased towards the underdogs<br>
we protect the weak where we are strong <br>
we expect protection where we are weak <br>
people should be allowed to say anything they want <br>
people should be allowed to run <br>
people shouldn’t hurt people and should keep the vulnerabilities of others in mind <br>
people should chase their good <br>
we care about our friends or anyone who seems cool <br>
we like to do drugs and go on adventures <br>
emotional appeals are valued highly on an interpersonal level but rarely generalised <br>
we have no culture, no race, no religion, no gender <br>
if someone wants to fight we stand stoically in our place or we turn and run and try to take ourselves with us  <br>
we love cowards and addicts lovers of peace and those who make bad decisions <br>
everything is preserved and lives on and we cherish the past and those who existed before <br>
if someone needs help to live we help them to live <br>
logic is fake — our language is our logic <br>
            we want to redistribute resources <br>
we love every feeling <br>
  education is the only method of rehabilitation and the only measure of growth <br>      
so much of the living is the being unknown<br>

        <br><br>
            you are not your state
            <br>
            if an institution uses community as an adjective, they are liars and you should run
            <br>
            don't count your sheeps before they jump
            <br>
            there is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is sheeps.
