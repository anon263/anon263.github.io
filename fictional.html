I listen to him fellate; he relays the bureaucratic intricacies that bolster his life and his thoughts and his plans <br>
He recounts a plethora of snivelling professors he works under, or intends to sink his teeth into; the philosophers, apparently latent, apparently like him <br>
The droning is methodical, like the incessant chanting of monks that is awe inspiring until the liminality and repetition makes your skin crawl and then, just when you think you can’t stand it anymore, in a shining moment of release, the vision hits.
<br><br>
The dark carcasses of petrified oak trees nudge a sandy shoreline, <br> washed up reminders of once gilded temples with spires that shone each morning to awaken the sun, <br>
of holy men and their dreams, <br>
of what we lost, crumbling now <br>
The philosophers shuffle around, wide eyes, glaze in fear at the lashing of a tongue <br>
Degraded and made pure, through inquisition made holy and true. Tender and stinging, they shuffle away <br>
Three years of class, three years watching your hands, semi-raised, long pale fingers balanced at your temple, steady, assured, <br>
Waiting to be called upon <br>
I know that feeling well <br>
It’s the feeling we live for, inside your heart rages, blowing out your pupils; they bleed into baby blue irises, blooming sweetly, shallow roots grip the edge of a cliff, exhaling puffs of altitude air, outside you remain serene and stone-carved <br>
I know that feeling well <br>
And suddenly the time has rushed towards you; it’s your turn to weave yourself into the fabric of the world, maybe even stun a novel crowd <br>
A straightening of the neck, sly and poised; <br>
<br><br>
The boy is seemingly prepared with another metered rebuttal, he is eloquent and practical in the extreme; <br>
I’ve studied that release <br>
your heart slows towards rest, satisfied, amused by some display of competence; the jaws clench and release <br>
I’ve studied that well <br>
<br><br>
‘Sadie’s questions are always brilliant,’ he tells Adam on our walk from class <br>
I burn, pushing through snow banks, enveloped by a severe night sky <br>
<br><br>
He looks down on the world; there is disgust, there is much to explore and to laugh at <br>
There is an old whitewashed door down the hall, if you walk inside you will find its room sparse, <br>nothing in the drawers, no curtains over the windows. the apartment is vacant and writhing,  <br>a bulbous writhing thing in the centre that looks afraid <br>
I was never raised in their image; never taught to win; <br>
            <br> <br>
back on the beach of damp fossils <br>
the sea is tempestuous, sand whips our ankles, revealing golden squares beneath our feet <br>
The things he tells me he does, to play the game I waltzed into, are shocks so painful and so blissful; first order catharsis; remind me to release <br>
hope, release, release ad absurdum;  <br>
I shiver, I have the flu tonight, I feel concrete around my shoulders and head, pushing them down, peaceful, throbbing. I am aching and inflamed; purifying hot sweat, baptised in hazy smoke; sublimated marijuana curls around the window pane  <br>
I am unclean, I have not showered. I am surrounded by old clothes and coffee mugs, sauce crusted to a plate on the bed and vape cartridges. I came twice today, drowning in apathy, I am afraid too. <br>
You tell me about the paper you wrote, the one on euthanasia, just like your mother writes, good boy. <br> <br>

His voice is measured and sweet, ‘people deserve to end their suffering, she’s seen the suffering.  They want to die, Sadie’ he yawns softly, on the brink of sleep <br>
‘What if the suffering matters?’ My wild eyes are flashing signals through the dark, the warning scan of a lighthouse <br>
He reclines, wave tossed and indifferent, succumbing to blissful fog <br>
I am imploring now, ‘what if you learn something? From that worthless pain. Don’t you think you learn something?’ Please tell me you learn something, ‘I mean of course everyone should have a choice’ <br>
‘That’s all I’m saying’ <br>
‘I just don’t think I could write an article on it’ <br>
‘Hmmm, you’ve never written an article’ <br>
<br><br>
‘I don’t know if academia is for you.’  <br>
I’ve never heard that before, and with such authority, I am open to the next lash, intensely curious, <br>
‘I mean all this stuff you complain about, elitism, luck, grades, gatekeeping, it’s not going to change; and it sounds like it depresses you.’ <br>
‘Everything depresses me.’ <br>
The gargantuan few perch like gods, sterile, needles poised for injection, they gaze upon us with their god eyes, benevolent, piteous, disaffected; ‘Hmmm, what a shame’ <br>
Meting out drugs, and teas, and creams, remedies they’ll never need,
<br><br>
You tell me I should really start eating healthier if I want to have the best chance at success; you prefer baby carrots and yogurt cups <br>
I tell you never tell me what to eat again, the nerves are raw <br>
You talk tutelage, the grant you asked for, stunning some senile holy man out of $10k worth of his research budget. <br>
You tell me about spidering, it’s the way you comb for research, check every bibliography, get a good sense of the literature; ‘it takes at least seven whole days.’ I find this useful. <br>
You talk shop, you’re waiting on this journal to review your article on euthanasia <br>
You flash with anger; the man who submitted an earlier paper to this journal, coming to a similar conclusion on euthanasia, is a ‘lazy asshat’. <br>
Staccato consonants, ‘he spends two pages explaining what an ‘argument from analogy’ is, like know your fucking audience, who the fuck do you think is reading The Canadian Journal of Bioethics?’ he spits out.  ‘Yeah you could just Google it,’ I say.  ‘Exactly.’ You tell me you’re just preparing for the pain of rejection; how indignation is so convenient, ‘don’t you agree?’ <br>
I must. <br>
‘I couldn’t submit to a typical undergrad journal,’ you explain, ‘my ego couldn’t take it’ <br>
Now there’s a typed legacy, waiting dutifully to be evaluated, there’s ten thousand dollars <br>languishing in a bank account, there’s multiple asshats <br>
On the night we met you told me, ‘I don’t work jobs,’ and I laughed <br><br>
You find the Twitter account of the man who’s peer reviewing your paper, he follows Dr. Anderson, the professor, your mom; ‘he just tweeted something about compassion, that’s a good sign,’ you chuckle <br>
‘She raised me … like a student,’ you explain when I ask where your compassion hides <br>
‘I see more possibilities with Barnes but I have a clear coherent structure for what I would write under Munoz,’ you’re really thinking <br>
‘I wonder if I could do two Directed Special Studies in the same summer, it’s a cool thought.  I could stagger them I could do one after the other; no it wouldn’t be worth it,’ you’re delighted <br>
‘Maybe I’ll relax.  This will be my last free summer; at least I expect it to be,’ Oxford shines ahead, ‘Perhaps if I don’t have distractions I can make something actually publishable,’ a pause, <br>
‘What are you going to do this summer?’ <br>
‘I don’t know. I shouldn’t have given up my old job. I need to work. I’m going to read, I’m going to write; the way I was meant to over the winter break’ <br>
‘Oh you couldn’t have written an article in that time’ <br>
‘I know’<br><br>
Often i find myself on that beach, with the natural structures ornately crafted by cause and the crumbling spires reaching towards the sun.
