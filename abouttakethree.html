ah the allure of academia ... submitting your most precious works to be scrutinized and inevitably rejected by a soulless corporation, or worse, a jury of your peers. maybe you're one of the lucky ones, you scrape past the suits with agendas poised to kill your darlings -- never unscathed; now you're published in some journal no one reads. your beloved is safely tucked away somewhere in a rubber stamped abyss. relegated to the tomes of 'literature', the dustbin of history. the academy screams into it's entropic void, a very well organised void, i admit. but here... here is much better. i guess.
